<h1>Phishing Email Investigation And Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I conduct a detailed analysis of a phishing email, identifying indicators of malicious activity. The email was retrieved from my personal spam inbox on Gmail, where it claimed that my system was infected with viruses. The email attempted to impersonate Google by using their logo and provided a link to supposedly remove the alleged threats.
<br />

<h2>Overview</h2>
To assess the authenticity of the email, I examined the sender details, subject line, and email body, and hovered over the embedded links to determine the adress destination. Additionally, I utilized third-party tools such as MXToolbox, URLScan, and Browserling to further analyze the email's content and headers. Through this comprehensive analysis, I determined that the email was indeed a phishing attempt designed to deceive recipients into downloading a malicious payload disguised as a legitimate virus removal tool, falsely representing itself as Google.
